some things were taken, inspired by, or edited, from the following people:
- JaKooLit - hyprland window rules, wallpaper-selector rofi theme
- Bread On Penguins - nvim + scripts + shell + zsh
- tonybtw - tokyonight themed waybar rofi and i believe kitty, if not just pulled that from the tokyo night theme site.
